there will be two folders, the first will be "HTML" save files, being meant for the HTML version
the second will be "C++ files" with the save files for the C++ version, my goal is for end-users not needing to make their own save files each time

instructions:
download either the latests release
launch the exe
import the save file

for personal:
download the latest release
run exe
that's it everything else should be self-explanatory
